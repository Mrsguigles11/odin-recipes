# odin-recipes

This is a website created as part of my learning on The Odin Project, which contains an index page with links to recipes for 3 different dishes. This project will demonstrate my skills with basic HTML including setting up a boilerplate, with a head and a body, as well as using lists, headings, paragraphs, images and hyperlinks. It will also demonstrate my competence with using git and github effectively.
