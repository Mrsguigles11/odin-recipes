    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whip up this easy pumpkin soup as a starter for a dinner party or a light supper 
       when you need a bit of comfort - it has a lovely silky texture</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>   
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1kg pumpkin or squash, peeled, deseeded and chopped into chunks</li>
        <li>700ml vegetable stock or chicken stock</li>
        <li>150ml double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, then gently cook 2 finely 
            chopped onions for 5 mins, until soft but not coloured.</li>
        <li>Add 1kg pumpkin or squash, cut into chunks, to the pan, then carry on 
            cooking for 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally until it starts to soften 
            and turn golden.</li>
        <li>Pour 700ml vegetable or chicken stock into the pan and season with salt 
            and pepper. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 mins until the squash 
            is very soft.</li> 
        <li>Pour 150ml double cream into the pan, bring back to the boil, then pur√©e 
            with a hand blender. For an extra-velvety consistency you can pour the soup 
            through a fine sieve. The soup can now be frozen for up to 2 months.</li> 
        <li>To make the croutons: cut 4 slices wholemeal seeded bread into small 
            squares.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan, then fry the bread until it starts 
            to become crisp.</li>
        <li>Add a handful of pumpkin seeds to the pan, then cook for a few mins more 
            until they are toasted. These can be made a day ahead and stored in an 
            airtight container.</li>
        <li>Reheat the soup if needed, taste for seasoning, then serve scattered with 
            croutons and seeds and drizzled with more olive oil, if you want.</li>                          
    </ol>
